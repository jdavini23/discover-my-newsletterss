# Vulnerability Fixing Guide

## Quick Reference

### 1. Vulnerability Scanning

```powershell
# Comprehensive vulnerability scan
npm audit

# Generate detailed vulnerability report
npm audit --json > vulnerability-report.json

# Scan with GitHub's Dependabot
gh dependabot alerts list
```

### 2. Vulnerability Remediation

```powershell
# Automatically fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Fix vulnerabilities with specific severity
npm audit fix --audit-level=high

# Update all packages to latest compatible versions
npm update

# Upgrade packages with known vulnerabilities
npm install package-name@latest
```

### 3. Advanced Dependency Management

```powershell
# Check package health and potential risks
npm outdated

# List packages with known security issues
npm audit --parseable

# Upgrade packages with minimal risk
npm-check -u
```

## Vulnerability Classification

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Urgent remediation needed
- **Moderate**: Address in next sprint
- **Low**: Monitor and plan update

### Vulnerability Types

- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Prototype Pollution
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Information Disclosure

## Remediation Strategies

### Automatic Fixes

1. Run `npm audit fix`
2. Verify test coverage
3. Perform regression testing

### Manual Intervention

1. Identify specific vulnerable dependencies
2. Research security advisories
3. Check package migration paths
4. Test compatibility with current codebase
5. Develop migration strategy

### Rollback Procedures

- Maintain lockfile versions
- Use version pinning
- Create dependency snapshots
- Implement canary deployments

## Security Best Practices

### Dependency Management

- Use `npm audit` regularly
- Enable Dependabot alerts
- Implement automated security scanning
- Maintain minimal dependency footprint

### Continuous Monitoring

- Weekly dependency reviews
- Monthly comprehensive audits
- Subscribe to security mailing lists
- Monitor GitHub security advisories

### Emergency Response

- Establish incident response plan
- Create rapid update workflow
- Maintain staging environment for testing
- Develop rollback mechanisms

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools

- npm audit
- Snyk
- GitHub Dependabot
- npm-check
- retire.js
- OWASP Dependency-Check

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate

- Critical vulnerabilities detected
- Potential system-wide compromise
- Unresolvable dependency conflicts
- Performance impact from security patches

### Escalation Workflow

1. Notify security team
2. Conduct immediate risk assessment
3. Develop mitigation strategy
4. Implement emergency patches
5. Perform comprehensive system review

## Compliance and Reporting

### Documentation

- Maintain vulnerability tracking log
- Document all security interventions
- Create detailed patch management reports

### Compliance Checklist

- GDPR
- CCPA
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS
- SOC 2

## Training and Awareness

### Team Education

- Regular security awareness training
- Dependency management workshops
- Incident response simulations

### Knowledge Sharing

- Maintain internal security wiki
- Conduct post-mortem analysis
- Share lessons learned
